/*
This CSS snippet is designed to ONLY apply the 'Inter' font
to the entire body of your website. It does not contain any
other layout, spacing, or color declarations.
*/

body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  /*
    The properties below are optional but recommended for better
    font rendering, especially on different operating systems.
    They don't affect layout.
  */
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; /* For Chrome/Safari on macOS */
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;  /* For Firefox on macOS */
}

/*
If you only want specific elements to use Inter (e.g., headings),
you would uncomment and modify rules like these instead of 'body':

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}

p {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
